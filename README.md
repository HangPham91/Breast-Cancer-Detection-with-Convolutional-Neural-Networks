# IDC Breast Cancer Classification Using CNN

## 🎯 1. Introduction:

- 🩺 **Background**
  - Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women.
  - Screenings like Mammograms, Ultrasound, MRI, and Biopsy help identify it.

- 🤖 **Project Objective**
  - This project applies **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to mammography screening data.
  - The model processes **100×100 pixel images** to classify patient tissue as **benign or cancerous**.

---

## 🛠️ 2. Tools and Skills:

- 💻 **Python Ecosystem**
  - pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

- 🤖 **TensorFlow/Keras**
  - CNN (Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dense, Dropout)
  - ImageDataGenerator

---

## 📌 3. Key Results:

- 🔍 **Model Architecture**
  - Built a 4-layer CNN for IDC vs. non-IDC classification

- 📊 **Evaluation & Visualization**
  - Visualized model performance (accuracy/loss plots)

- 🏆 **Performance**
  - Achieved high training and validation accuracy of 87%
