Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women. A variety of screenings, such as Mammograms, Breast Ultrasound, Breast MRI, or Biopsy, can identify breast cancer.
In this project, I will focus on using Convolutional Neural Networks, a deep learning model, to process and analyze a dataset of patient mammography screenings. By constructing a neural network model and training and testing samples of 100x100 pixel images, we can predict whether a patientâ€™s tissue is benign or cancerous.
